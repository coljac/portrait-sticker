# Character sticker

This simple application takes a character sheet and inserts an image into it. It fixes some issues where the exported PDF from D&D Beyond (for instance) lacks a character portrait.

Note: Form-fillable PDFs may not work as expected, as the image may appear under a fillable form field. Consider flattening the PDF first (for instance, using the "Print to PDF" option in your browser) to ensure the image is added correctly.

It knows about a few of the standard character sheet formats. With a bit of experimentation you should be able to get it into the right location of any PDF.
